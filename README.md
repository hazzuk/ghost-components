# ghost-components
Scripts, styles and templates created for my personal [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost) blog. Primarily designed for the default Ghost theme [Source](https://github.com/TryGhost/Source), with a dark colour theme.

Use of inline scripts and styling should be avoided to enable strong [CSP rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

## Components
Standalone additions for features not found in Ghost's [editor cards](https://ghost.org/help/cards/). To use, save the HTML templates as [editor snippets](https://ghost.org/help/snippets/) and link the associated script/stylesheet.
